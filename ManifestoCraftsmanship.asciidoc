= Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship

Raising the bar.


As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

[big]#Not only working software, but also *well-crafted software*#

[big]#Not only responding to change, but also *steadily adding value*#

[big]#Not only individuals and interactions, but also *a community of professionals*#

[big]#Not only customer collaboration, but also *productive partnerships*#

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
